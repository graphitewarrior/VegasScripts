[Simple Camera Shake effect.](Shake Selected Clip.cs)
It will create a "camera during earthquake" movement on the selected video clip. It uses Pan + Crop keyframes to achieve this. It is fully configurable.

This is a fork of the script containing a version compatible with newer versions of Vegas that do not use the same pathways as the original. I also added "Autosize" to all the UI elements so they are more accessible on differently sized screens, though I am yet to test it and am happy to fix any scaling issues.
